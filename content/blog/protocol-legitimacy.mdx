# Protocol Legitimacy: The Final Mile

Today we announce the completion of our **Protocol Legitimacy** milestone, marking the finalization of MPLP's narrative scope and the launch of critical enterprise evaluation surfaces.

As of December 19, 2025, the MPLP website and protocol narrative are officially **FROZEN**.

## The "Stop-Line" Declaration

We have established a definitive "Stop-Line" for the protocol's narrative. This means:

1.  **No New "Sales" Pitches**: The time for "Why MPLP" expansion is over. The core value proposition is set.
2.  **Focus on Verification**: Future updates will strictly focus on RFCs, Spec evolution, and SDK implementation.
3.  **Governance First**: All new content must pass through the [MPGC](/governance/overview) RFC process.

## New: Enterprise Evaluation Guide

For enterprise architects and investors conducting due diligence, we have launched the [Enterprise Evaluation Guide](/enterprise).

This resource provides a closed-loop evaluation path:
- **Playbook**: structured audit of the Governance -> Compliance -> Traceability chain.
- **Signals**: Real-time adoption and conformance metrics.
- **Trace**: "Replayable Audit Record" over "Immutable Ledger" — precise, legally sound terminology.

## ISO/NIST Usage Boundaries

We have explicitly defined the "Usage Boundary" for our [ISO 42001](/governance/iso-iec-42001) and [NIST AI RMF](/governance/nist-ai-rmf) mappings.

> **Note**: MPLP provides informative reference mappings. We do not issue certifications or compliance badging. Responsibility remains with the adopting organization.

## Security & Stability

The platform has been upgraded to **Next.js 16.1.0**, incorporating the latest security patches. The entire site is now a static, secure artifact served from the edge.

## Final Status

```text

The protocol is ready for your evaluation.
