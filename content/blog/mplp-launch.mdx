# MPLP v1.0.0 is Now Frozen

Today marks a significant milestone for the AI agent ecosystem: **MPLP v1.0.0 is officially frozen**.

## What Does "Frozen" Mean?

When we say a specification is frozen, we mean:

1. **L1 Invariants are permanent** — The Agent Schema, Lifecycle States, and Message Contract will never change
2. **Backward compatibility is guaranteed** — Any agent built to v1.0.0 will work forever
3. **The foundation is stable** — Build with confidence knowing the core won't shift

## What's Included in v1.0.0

The frozen specification includes:

- **4-Layer Architecture** — Invariants, Core Modules, Optional Modules, Extensions
- **10 Core Modules** — Everything needed to build production agents
- **9 Cross-Cutting Concerns** — Observability, Security, Governance, and more
- **5 Golden Flows** — Reference implementations of common patterns

## What's Next?

While L1 is frozen, MPLP continues to evolve:

- v1.1.0 will expand L3 with enhanced observability
- v1.2.0 will add advanced coordination patterns
- Community feedback shapes L3/L4 development
