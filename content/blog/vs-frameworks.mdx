# MPLP vs Agent Frameworks

"Should I use MPLP or LangChain?"

This is the wrong question. It's like asking "Should I use HTTP or Express?" You use both — at different layers.

## Protocol vs Framework

| Aspect | MPLP (Protocol) | Frameworks |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Defines | What & Why | How |
| Level | Specification | Implementation |
| Vendor | Neutral | Specific |
| Changes | Rarely | Frequently |

## How They Work Together

Think of it this way:

- **MPLP** defines that agents must have lifecycle states (SPAWNING → IDLE → EXECUTING → TERMINATED)
- **LangChain/AutoGen/CrewAI** implements those states in their runtime

Your LangChain agent can be MPLP-conformant. Your AutoGen conversation can follow MPLP patterns.

## Framework Relationships

### LangChain
LangChain provides chains, agents, and tools. MPLP defines lifecycle contracts that LangChain agents can implement.

### AutoGen
AutoGen excels at multi-agent conversations. MPLP's coordination patterns map to AutoGen conversation flows.

### CrewAI
CrewAI orchestrates role-playing agents. MPLP's Supervisor-Worker flow aligns with CrewAI's crew concept.

## The Bottom Line

Use frameworks for implementation. Use MPLP for interoperability, observability, and governance.
