# From Prompt Engineering to Protocol Engineering

The AI industry has a problem. We've mastered making LLMs do impressive things with carefully crafted prompts, but we're building multi-agent systems on sand.

## The Prompt Engineering Era

For the past two years, "Prompt Engineering" has been the dominant paradigm:

- Craft the perfect system prompt
- Add few-shot examples
- Hope the model understands your intent
- Debug by trial and error

This works for single interactions. It fails for complex systems.

## Why Prompts Aren't Enough

When you're building a system with multiple agents that need to:

- **Coordinate** — Share context and negotiate
- **Recover** — Handle failures gracefully
- **Scale** — Work across distributed systems
- **Observe** — Provide visibility into what's happening

...you need more than prompts. You need **protocols**.

## The Protocol Engineering Paradigm

Protocol Engineering is about defining:

1. **Contracts** — What agents promise to each other
2. **Lifecycles** — How agents are born, live, and die
3. **Invariants** — What must always be true
4. **Observability** — How we see inside the system

MPLP is the first comprehensive protocol for multi-agent lifecycles.
